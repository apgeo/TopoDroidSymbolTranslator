# TopoDroidTranslator

This is a tool for helping translating [TopoDroid ][1] symbol objects to another language.

It works by opening the symbols-git directory from the TopoDroid sources directory. It will read all symbol files and you will be able to modify or add new translations.

This tool is experimental and may lead to information loss. Please backup your local repository files before using it every time.

It is developed using .NET (C#) and it runs on Windows.
